# Bayesian zero-inflated generalized Poisson regression model: estimation and case influence diagnostics

In this project, we mainly study the zero-inflated generalized Poisson (ZIGP) regression model and examine its analysis from a Bayesian point of view by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. This model offers a way of modelling the excess zeros in addition to avoiding the over dispersed or under dispersed relative to Poisson. Meanwhile, the model selection criteria and Bayesian case influence diagnostics based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence are studied. Furthermore, to illustrate the performance of the developed methodology we apply the real word examples, we select the data set “Couple” to analyze. The author of the original literature gave results of the analysis but the code and the tools about the analysis are unpublished and private. In our study,we use R program to analysis the same data set and approach the similar results in the end.
